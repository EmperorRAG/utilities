---

Automate the following steps for this npm project, **requiring explicit user approval before each important step** (version increment, build, publish). Use the built-in user approval mechanism for confirmations:

**Before starting:**

1. **Ensure all desired symbols are exported from src/index.ts.**
    - First, follow the instructions in `.github/prompts/sync-exports.prompt.md` to synchronize all exports in `src/index.ts` with the module files in `src/lib`. Only proceed to the next steps if this completes successfully.

**Main workflow:** 2. **Load the NPM_TOKEN from the `.env` file into the terminal environment.** - Use a tool like `dotenv-cli` or manually export the variable. - Example (Linux/macOS): `export $(grep NPM_TOKEN .env | xargs)` - Example (Windows CMD): `for /f "usebackq tokens=*" %i in (.env) do set %i` - Example (Windows PowerShell): `$env:NPM_TOKEN="$(Get-Content .env | Select-String NPM_TOKEN | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString().Split('=')[1].Trim() })"` - Example (dotenv-cli): `dotenv -e .env -- <your command>`

3. **Increment the npm package version.**
    - Before running `npm version <patch|minor|major>`, prompt the user for approval and confirm the version bump type.
    - Use `npm version <patch|minor|major>` as appropriate.

4. **Commit and push changes.**
    - After updating `src/index.ts` and/or bumping the npm version, commit these changes before proceeding.
    - When committing, use the "Generate Commit Message" action if available, unless the agent can generate a more descriptive and context-aware commit message based on the actual changes. If so, prefer the agent-generated message.
    - Push the commit to the repository before proceeding.

5. **Run the build command.**
    - Before executing `npm run build`, prompt the user for approval.
    - Execute `npm run build`.
    - If there are any build issues, paste the error output in the chat.
    - Analyze the errors, explain what they mean, and provide possible solutions based on the project workspace.

6. **Run a dry-run publish.**
    - Before executing `npm publish --dry-run`, prompt the user for approval.
    - Execute `npm publish --dry-run`.
    - If there are any issues, paste the error output, explain, and provide possible solutions.

7. **Publish the package.**
    - Before executing `npm publish`, prompt the user for final approval.
    - Execute `npm publish`.

**Notes:**

- If any step fails, stop and provide a detailed explanation and troubleshooting steps.
- Ensure the NPM_TOKEN is not exposed in logs or output.
- This automation is intended to streamline the build and publish workflow for this npm project while minimizing risk by requiring user approval at each important step.
